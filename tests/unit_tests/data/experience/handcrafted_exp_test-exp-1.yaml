when: |
  Use this experience when:
  - User requests to read or process data from a CSV file
  - File path is provided (relative or absolute)
  - Previous attempts resulted in FileNotFoundError
  - Working with pandas DataFrame operations on CSV files

  Triggers:
  - Keywords: "CSV", "data file", "read file", "load data"
  - Error patterns: FileNotFoundError, file not found
  - User provides file path like "./data.csv" or "path/to/file.csv"

what: |
  Best Practices for File Operations:
  1. Always check if file exists before attempting to read:
     ```python
     import os
     if os.path.exists(file_path):
         data = pd.read_csv(file_path)
     else:
         print(f"File not found: {file_path}")
     ```

  2. Use os.path.abspath() to get absolute path for debugging

  3. Handle common errors gracefully:
     - FileNotFoundError: Check path, suggest alternatives
     - PermissionError: Check file permissions
     - pd.errors.EmptyDataError: Verify file has content

  4. When user provides new file path, update the path variable immediately

  Common Mistakes to Avoid:
  - Don't assume files exist without checking (os.path.exists)
  - Don't use hardcoded paths when user provides dynamic paths
  - Don't ignore FileNotFoundError - handle it with helpful messages
